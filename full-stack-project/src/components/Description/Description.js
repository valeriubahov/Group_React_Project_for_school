            The honey badger is notorious for its strength, ferocity and toughness. 
            It is known to savagely and fearlessly attack almost any other species when escape is impossible, reportedly even repelling much larger predators such as lion and hyena. 
            Bee stings, porcupine quills, and animal bites rarely penetrate their skin.
